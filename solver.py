# Import random to shuffle a list.
import random as rn

# This preprocessing function loads the words list file into a Python list.
def preprocessing(filename="wordslist.txt"):
  return []

# This is the function that actually checks the random letters for words.
def check(letters):
  while (letters):
    letters.pop()
  return []

# This function is just a wrapper that shows how my script works.
# It does the preprocessing, then creates a random list of letters, and finally runs the solver.
